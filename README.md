##### Using Stanford Dogs Dataset to create a website that can help prevent dog illnesses based on the breed! 

1. The user will upload their dog's image on our site 

2. the software will recognize the breed and give the user information on the breed's history, lifespan, potential illnesses, symptoms, and potential testing of these illnesses.

3. The user will be able to save this information as a pdf or can provide their email to receive this information.
